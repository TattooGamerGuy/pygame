"""
Integration tests for DisplayManager - Template for Agent 1

This file serves as a template demonstrating the structure, patterns, and approach
Agent 1 should follow when creating all integration tests.

Key Patterns Demonstrated:
- TDD approach (tests define requirements, may fail until implementation)
- Mobile-first testing (various screen sizes, aspect ratios)
- Integration testing (testing system interactions, not just unit behavior)
- Proper fixtures and cleanup
- Performance considerations
- Edge cases and error handling

Agent 1 should replicate this pattern for all other integration test files.

TESTING NOTES FOR AGENT 1:

1. Structure:
   - Group related tests into classes
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
   - Follow the pattern: Test[System][Feature]

2. Mobile-First Approach:
   - Always test with mobile resolutions
   - Use parametrization for multiple configurations
   - Consider mobile performance constraints (30 FPS targets)

3. Integration Testing Focus:
   - Test system interactions, not just unit behavior
   - Test lifecycle (init, use, cleanup, reinit)
   - Test multiple instances when relevant
   - Test error conditions and edge cases

4. TDD Approach:
   - Write tests that define expected behavior
   - Tests may fail initially - that's expected
   - Tests serve as documentation of requirements

5. Performance Testing:
   - Include performance benchmarks where relevant
   - Test frame time requirements (60 FPS desktop, 30 FPS mobile)
   - Test initialization and cleanup speed

6. Code Organization:
   - Use fixtures for common setup/teardown
   - Use parametrization for similar test cases
   - Group related tests in classes
   - Document complex test logic

7. Naming Conventions:
   - Test classes: Test[System][Feature]
   - Test methods: test_[feature]_[expected_behavior]
   - Fixtures: descriptive names (e.g., desktop_resolution, mobile_resolutions)

8. Coverage Goals:
   - Aim for >80% code coverage
   - Test all public APIs
   - Test error conditions
   - Test edge cases

9. Mobile Device Matrix:
   - iPhone SE (320x568)
   - iPhone 12/13 (390x844)
   - iPhone Pro Max (428x926)
   - iPad (768x1024)
   - Android small/medium/large variants

10. Common Patterns to Replicate:
    - Lifecycle tests (init, use, cleanup, reinit)
    - Mobile resolution parametrization
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Error handling verification
    - Multi-instance behavior (when applicable)
    - Integration with other systems

Agent 1 should use this file as a template and replicate these patterns
for all other integration test files across the test suite.
