# Modular Refactoring Status

## Completed Modules

### ✅ Core Module (`hub/core/`)
- **display.py**: Window and display management separated from main
- **audio.py**: Audio system initialization and management
- **clock.py**: Frame timing and delta time calculation
- **engine.py**: Main engine orchestrator that combines all core systems

### ✅ Configuration Module (`hub/config/`)
- **defaults.py**: All default configuration values
- **settings.py**: Persistent settings with JSON file support
- **config_service.py**: Service for applying config to systems

### ✅ Events Module (`hub/events/`)
- **event_bus.py**: Publisher/subscriber event system
- **events.py**: Event type definitions (SceneChangeEvent, GameStartEvent, etc.)

### ✅ Services Module (`hub/services/`)
- **input_service.py**: Centralized input handling with event integration
- **audio_service.py**: Audio playback service with volume control
- **config_service.py**: Configuration application service

### ✅ Manager Module (`hub/manager/`)
- **scene_manager.py**: Scene lifecycle management with event integration
- **game_registry.py**: Game registration system with metadata support

## Current Architecture

├── core/           ✅ Complete - Engine, Display, Audio, Clock
├── config/          ✅ Complete - Settings and defaults
├── events/          ✅ Complete - Event bus and event types
├── services/        ✅ Complete - Input, Audio, Config services

└── main.py          ⚠️  Old version (main_modular.py is new)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. UI Framework (`hub/ui/`)
- Create base widget system
- Refactor existing Button into UI framework
- Create layout containers
- Add theming system

### 2. Refactor Scenes
- Update `BaseScene` to work with event bus
- Update `HubScene` to use new UI framework
- Remove direct dependencies on pygame from scenes

### 3. Refactor Games
- Update games to use InputService instead of direct pygame input
- Integrate with event bus for game events
- Use services for audio playback

### 4. Migration
- Update main.py to use modular version
- Test all games work with new system
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition

## Usage Example

The new modular system can be used like this:

```python
# Create and initialize
hub = ModularGameHub()
hub.run()
```

The system automatically:
- Loads configuration from file
- Initializes all core systems
- Sets up event bus
- Registers all scenes
- Manages scene transitions via events
- Handles input through service layer

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services passed to components
3. **Event-Driven**: Decoupled communication via event bus
4. **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new games, services, or features
6. **Configuration**: Centralized settings with persistence
7. **Maintainability**: Clear module boundaries and interfaces

## Files Created

- `hub/core/` - 5 files
- `hub/config/` - 3 files
- `hub/events/` - 3 files
- `hub/services/` - 4 files
- `hub/manager/` - 3 files
- `hub/main_modular.py` - New modular entry point
- `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` - Architecture plan
- `MODULAR_REFACTOR_STATUS.md` - This file

Total: ~21 new modular files created

## Testing the Modular Version

To test the new modular system:

```bash
python3 -m hub.main_modular
```

Note: This may need updates to scenes/games to work fully. The old `main.py` still works with the existing codebase.
